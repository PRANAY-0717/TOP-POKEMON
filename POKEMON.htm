            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/006.png" alt="CHARIZARD">
            <h4>Charizard (Ash’s Charizard)</h4>
            <p>Ash’s Charizard isn't just fire-type — he is fire. From a rebellious Charmander to a full-blown battle beast, this dude's glow-up is legendary. When he roasted Articuno — a freakin’ Legendary Ice Bird — the whole fandom lost it. That wasn't just a battle; that was Charizard saying, “I ain’t playin’ no more.” He’s got Flamethrower for days, Dragon Claw like a boss, and when he Mega Evolves? Bro turns into a dragon god. Whether it’s Kanto, Johto, or Kalos — when Charizard shows up, you know it’s go time. He’s the OG firestarter in Ash’s squad, and he’s earned every flame on that tail.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="A2">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/244.png" alt="ENTEI">
            <h4>Entei</h4>
            <p>Entei ain’t your regular wild Fire-type — this dude is a straight-up volcano with legs. When Entei steps in, the battlefield shakes with pure heat. Created by Ho-Oh and wrapped in mystic vibes, Entei isn’t just power  he’s divine-level flame. In Pokémon 3: The Movie, he literally rewrote reality to protect a girl, and that wasn’t even his full potential. When Entei roars, you feel it in your chest. He’s not here to play tag  he’s here to burn legends into existence. Bow down, because when this beast runs, entire forests catch fire behind him.</p>

        </div>

            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/257.png" alt="BLAZIKEN">
            <h4>Blaziken (May’s / Mega Blaziken)</h4>
            <p>Yo, Blaziken throws hands — and kicks, and flips, and burns. This fiery bird ain't got time for cute — it's all about clean combos and savage wins. When Blaziken lights up the scene with Blaze Kick or Sky Uppercut, you know someone's getting wrecked. And when it goes Mega, it turns into a blazing rocket of destruction. In battles, Blaziken moves like it’s in a martial arts anime — fast, furious, and flashy. From taking down rival starters to throwing down in climactic contests, this fighter's got heart, heat, and hands. Respect the flames or get toasted.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="A4">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/392.png" alt="INFERNAPE">
            <h4>Infernape (Ash’s Infernape)</h4>
            <p>Infernape’s story ain’t just battle — it’s redemption, rage, and raw power. This dude went from Paul’s abandoned trash to Ash’s ultimate clutch play. When Blaze activates, bro’s flames shoot higher than your dreams. The Monferno-to-Infernape arc was pure shonen energy — revenge, growth, and that final KO on Electivire? Peak anime chills. With moves like Flare Blitz and Close Combat, Infernape doesn’t just fight — it unleashes soul fire. This is a warrior with scars and story, and when he burns, it’s with purpose. He’s not just hot — he’s hero hot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="A5">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/643.png" alt="RESHIRAM">
            <h4>Reshiram</h4>
            <p>Reshiram ain’t just fire — it’s truth incarnate riding on a whirlwind of white flames. A literal Dragon of Legends, this majestic beast doesn’t battle it judges. When Reshiram flares up its Blue Flare, the whole sky gets a sunburn. In Black & White, it doesn’t even need to flex — its presence alone makes other Pokémon sweat bullets. You mess with reality, Reshiram resets it with divine fire. Graceful, god-tier, and ghosting in legend this dragon doesn’t spit bars, it drops prophecies in flames. Legendary status? Nah bro, it's above that.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="A6">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/146.png" alt="MOLTRES">
            <h4>Moltres</h4>
            <p>Moltres is the original flame bird — no cap. It doesn’t talk, it doesn’t hesitate — it just burns. When this phoenix takes flight, the clouds part like they're scared. With wings like wildfire and a glare that screams “I was born to torch,” Moltres flies through storms and leaves trails of fire in the sky. From being the sacred protector to battling in epic clashes like in The Power of One, it’s got myth energy. When you see those flames light up the night, one thing’s clear: Moltres doesn’t land — it descends.</p>
        </div>

     <!-- THIS IS FOR WATER TYPE POKEMON PAGE  -->
     <div class="container" id="T2">
        <div class="box" id="B1">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/658_f2.png" alt="Ash-Greninja">
            <h4> Greninja (Ash’s Greninja)</h4>
            <p>Greninja didn’t just break the meta — he broke the anime. This ninja frog slid in, masked up, and flipped the whole battlefield with Water Shuriken like it’s throwing stars at light speed. And when that Ash-Greninja Bond Phenomenon activated? BOOM — he unlocked a power so unique the Kalos League built hype around it. Greninja’s agility is next-level, its hits are precise, and its drip? Unmatched. This ain’t just a Water-type — it’s the shuriken-slinging shadow king of the anime.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="B2">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/382.png" alt="Kyogre">
            <h4>Kyogre</h4>
            <p>Yo, Kyogre ain’t splashing in puddles — it’s out here summoning oceans. This ancient whale ain’t just big — it’s primordial power in motion. When it rolls up, skies darken, the rain pours, and land Pokémon start catching cold feet. With moves like Origin Pulse and Thunder-predicting Drizzle, Kyogre controls the weather like it’s changing tracks on a playlist. You mess with the sea, Kyogre makes you drown in regret. This beast didn’t just battle — it rewrote the climate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="B3">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/130.png" alt="Gyarados">
            <h4>Gyarados</h4>
            <p>From flopping Magikarp to dragon of doom — Gyarados is the anime’s ultimate flex. When this sea serpent rises, even the toughest trainers gulp. Its Hyper Beam is like a nuke from the ocean, and when it Mega Evolves? Say goodbye to the arena. Misty’s Gyarados had raw emotion and battle scars, and even Team Rocket gave up whenever one showed up. Gyarados don’t swim — it doms the deep. Rage mode ON, destruction IMMINENT.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="B4">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/134.png" alt="Vaporeon">
            <h4>Vaporeon</h4>
            <p>Don’t sleep on the sleek — Vaporeon’s the silent assassin of Water-types. This Eeveelution glides in with grace and battles like a tidal wave dressed in silk. From gym battles to contests, Vaporeon always brought that liquid smooth energy. Its Acid Armor vanishes it like a ghost, and Hydro Pump hits like a surprise KO. Whether it’s strategy, beauty, or clean power — Vaporeon’s got that aesthetic AND artillery. Don’t test the tide, bro.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="B5">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/350.png" alt="Milotic">
            <h4>Milotic</h4>
            <p>Milotic isn’t just powerful — it’s breathtaking. Known as the most beautiful Pokémon, it lures opponents in with elegance and then wrecks them with wave after wave. You think it’s just for show? Nah — this serpent swims with Surf and Dragon Pulse that drops jaws. In contests or the battlefield, Milotic flows like poetry then crashes like thunder. Even Wallace built his whole Elite Squad around this one. Grace with a splash of wrath? That’s Milotic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="B6">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/245.png" alt="Suicune">
            <h4>Suicune</h4>
            <p>Suicune moves like the wind and strikes like a wave. This Legendary Beast ain't loud — it’s legendary in silence. Whenever Suicune shows up in the anime, it's like nature itself bows down. Purifying water, outrunning rockets, and slicing with Aurora Beam like it's no big deal. It’s got speed, serenity, and savage power all rolled into one icy-blue blur. Suicune doesn’t attack — it flows through battles like art in motion. Pure legend vibes.</p>
        </div>

     <!-- THIS IS FOR GRASS TYPE POKEMON PAGE  -->
      <div class="container" id="T3">
        <div class="box" id="C1">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/254.png" alt="Sceptile">
            <h4>Sceptile (Ash’s Sceptile)</h4>
            <p>Sceptile is built different. This green-bladed beast is the literal samurai of the forest. Calm, cool, collected — until you mess with it. Then it drops a Leaf Blade so sharp, it sliced through a freakin’ Darkrai like butter in the Sinnoh League. That moment? Anime hall-of-fame. Sceptile doesn’t flinch, doesn’t bluff — it just waits, aims, and claps with crits. No armor, no Mega, just pure Grass-type gangster energy. If there’s a silent killer in Ash’s lineup, it’s this tree ninja.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="C2">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/003.png" alt="Venusaur">
            <h4>Venusaur</h4>
            <p>You see that giant flower? Yeah, it ain’t just for vibes — Venusaur’s the jungle boss. From Gym Leaders to Champions, this bulky beast stomps with Frenzy Plant like the earth itself’s mad. In the anime, when Venusaur shows up, the tone shifts — it’s like the forest itself sent a final warning. With status moves, raw tankiness, and a vibe like “I’ve been here since Gen 1 — respect me,” Venusaur is the OG green giant. You don’t beat a Venusaur — you survive it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="C3">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/389.png" alt="Torterra">
            <h4>Torterra (Paul’s & Ash’s Torterra)</h4>
            <p>Torterra doesn’t rush — Torterra rumbles. This dude is a walking continent. Ash’s Torterra was all about grit and growth, while Paul’s was a tank with IQ. With Earthquake and Leaf Storm, this bulky brawler ain't here to dodge — it stands firm and says, “Hit me, I dare you.” And when it lands one? The enemy’s flying into next week. It’s not flashy — it’s raw wilderness power. Big, wise, and grounded — literally.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="C4">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/492_f2.png" alt="Shaymin">
            <h4>Shaymin (Sky Forme)</h4>
            <p>Don’t let the cuteness fool you — Sky Shaymin goes full anime protagonist mode. Once it transforms, it’s like a little grassy jet, slicing through battles with Air Slash, Energy Ball, and that “I got this” energy. In Giratina and the Sky Warrior, Shaymin went from grumpy bean to sky-surfing savior. It’s fast, bold, and sassy — your typical underdog-turned-MVP. If you blink, you miss the hit — Shaymin’s too quick for the replay.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="C5">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/470.png" alt="Leafeon">
            <h4>Leafeon</h4>
            <p>Leafeon is precision in a leaf. This sleek Eeveelution mixes grace with razor-sharp technique. It doesn’t just fight — it dances through the battlefield, turning dodges into art and slashes into statements. From Coordinators to Trainers, Leafeon was that aesthetic threat — fast, fierce, and fab. Its Leaf Blade sparkled like it belonged in a music video, but the damage? Very real. Elegant violence — that’s Leafeon’s whole vibe.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="C6">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/763.png" alt="Tsareena">
            <h4>Tsareena</h4>
            <p>Yo, Tsareena ain't just royalty she’s the Queen of Kicks. With legs that could KO an Onix, this Grass-type steps in like, “Who said flowers can’t fight?” Her Trop Kick and High Jump Kick combo? STRAIGHT SMOKE. Tsareena brings that attitude confident, stylish, and always in control. When Mallow’s Tsareena strutted into action, you knew she wasn’t just there to support she was there to dominate. Grace meets gangsta in green.

            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/025.png" alt="Pikachu">
            <h4>Pikachu (Ash’s Pikachu)</h4>
            <p>Pikachu ain’t just a mascot — he’s the main event. From frying legendaries like Regice, tanking hits from Mega Lucario, to clapping a freakin’ Latios in the Masters Eight — this yellow bolt ain’t here for cute points. He’s fast, he’s fierce, and that Iron Tail + Electro Ball combo? Straight anime flames. Pikachu may be small, but every time he yells “Pika-CHUUU!” someone’s team goes into cardiac arrest. He’s the OG — Ash’s ace, fandom’s king, and the shock that started it all.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="D2">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/644.png" alt="Zekrom">
            <h4>Zekrom</h4>
            <p>Zekrom doesn’t spark — he surges reality. This Legendary from Unova is pure electric rage with wings, crackling with truth and thunder. In the anime, when Zekrom appears, the whole sky goes dark like Netflix buffering. It literally reset Pikachu’s powers — that’s how real it is. And when it charges up with Bolt Strike, you either dodge or get deleted. Zekrom ain't just Electric — he's divine voltage in dragon form.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="D3">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/466.png" alt="Electivire">
            <h4>Electivire (Paul’s Electivire)</h4>
            <p>Electivire’s got hands AND volts. Paul’s final evolution for his Elekid line turned into a battlefield bully. Whether it was clashing with Infernape or flexing on type advantages, Electivire was always one move ahead — strategic AND savage. Its Thunder Punch hits like a truck, and the Motor Drive ability? Bro literally says, “Thanks for the boost, loser.” Paul may be cold, but Electivire brought that controlled chaos. You don’t fight it — you try to survive the storm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="D4">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/405.png" alt="Luxray">
            <h4>Luxray</h4>
            <p>Luxray’s got that sleek predator energy. This electric lion doesn’t roar — it crackles with confidence. In the anime, whether it's Clemont’s Luxray or the wild ones lurking in Sinnoh, Luxray always gives main character energy. It’s fast, tactical, and its Electric Terrain + Wild Charge combo leaves trainers shocked and smoked. Luxray’s eyes pierce through anything — including illusions and weakness. Stylish, loyal, and lethal — that’s royalty in fur.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="D5">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/026.png" alt="Raichu">
            <h4>Raichu</h4>
            <p>Raichu is Pikachu’s evolved form, but he’s not just “older bro” — he’s the gym-level nightmare. Lt. Surge’s Raichu in Kanto? Straight bully mode. Raw power, Thunderbolt like a cannon blast, and that battle made Pikachu train for speed and agility. Raichu brings that thicc electric pressure — no warm-up needed, just zap and KO. He may not get the spotlight often, but when he’s in, it’s volts over vibes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="D6">
            <img src="https://www.pokemon.com/static-assets/content-assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/785.png" alt="Tapu Koko">
            <h4>Tapu Koko</h4>
            <p>Tapu Koko is wild electricity with a guardian soul. This Alolan deity don’t play favorites — it chose Ash, challenged him, and clashed with his best like a final boss. With Electric Surge, it literally turns the ground into a danger zone. Nature’s Madness? Yeah, that's “half your HP, gone — just vibes.” Fast, erratic, divine — Tapu Koko isn’t here for glory, it's here to test worthiness. And in that final clash with Ash’s Pikachu? That wasn’t a battle — it was a legend in motion.</p>
        </div>

                <h4>Mewtwo</h4>
                <p>Mewtwo ain’t just strong — he’s built like a final boss with main villain trauma. This dude came out of the lab with an identity crisis and Psychic powers so cracked, he lifted an entire stadium just to flex. In Mewtwo Strikes Back, he didn’t fight Trainers — he judged them. Shadow Ball? One-shot. Barrier? Unbreakable. Telepathy? Always in your head. Mewtwo ain’t just Psychic-type — he’s philosophy with a grudge. If power had a face, it’d float with glowing eyes and speak calmly while wrecking everything.</p>

                <h4>Alakazam</h4>
                <p>Don’t let the spoons fool you — Alakazam’s mind game is deadly. This psychic beast’s IQ is said to hit 5,000, and in the anime, it battles like it’s already seen the next 10 moves. Teleport, Psybeam, Confusion — all while staying cooler than a Glalie in December. Sabrina’s Alakazam? Bro didn’t flinch once. Just sat there and broke Pokémon with its mind. Fast, precise, and spooky — this is your chess master with a nuke in every move.</p>

                <h4>Gardevoir</h4>
                <p>Gardevoir is elegance with edge. One moment she’s glowing with grace, next she’s throwing up Protect and Psychic like a literal magical shield maiden. In Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys, Gardevoir was out here warping dimensions and taking hits that would floor most Pokémon. This ain't no sidekick — it's “I’ll throw hands — and minds” energy. Teleportation? Check. Emotional intelligence? Double check. Gardevoir’s not just beauty — she’s battlefield ballet with a psychic punch.</p>

                <h4>Metagross (Steven’s Metagross)</h4>
                <p>Metagross don’t talk — it calculates your L in real time. This four-legged steel brain is part supercomputer, part beatdown machine. Steven Stone’s ace in the anime hits like a tank and moves with precision like a chess grandmaster on speed. When Metagross goes Mega, it’s “math meets madness.” Think Zen Headbutt to the skull with no warning. This isn’t a Pokémon — this is Google Search with fists. Big brain + big brawn? GG.</p>

                <h4>Latios</h4>
                <p>Latios = sky-high psychic sniper. In Pokémon Heroes, he wasn’t just flying — he was protecting a city solo, dodging missiles, phasing through dimensions, and blasting with Luster Purge like it’s divine wrath. Latios doesn’t just fly — he weaves through timelines. Silent, loyal, and devastating in combat — he’s the kind of Pokémon that says “I don’t want to fight… but if I do, it’s over.” Speed + psychic + heart? That’s anime power trio right there.</p>

                <h4>Espeon (Anabel’s Espeon)</h4>
                <p>Espeon is telepathic finesse wrapped in velvet. From the Battle Frontier to countless anime arcs, this Eeveelution is all about quick reads and quicker strikes. Anabel’s Espeon could predict moves like it had future sight running in real-time — clean dodges, perfect counters, no wasted motion. It’s got that “float like a dream, sting like a scream” vibe. Psychic types may be calm, but Espeon? It hits with elegance and exits with silence.</p>

                <h3>
Hey, I’m Pranay Jaiswal — a 19-year-old engineering student by day, and a full-time Pokémon enthusiast by passion! You could say my journey started like every great Trainer’s: with a curious mind, a determined heart, and a burning desire to level up — whether it’s in coding, design, or defeating the Elite Four of life.

My Pokémon World Parallel
Just like Ash started with Pikachu and evolved through every region, I’ve been evolving too — from writing my first line of code in C to now building full-fledged web projects, solving DSA problems, and dreaming up AI-powered assistants. My favorite type? Fire, hands down. Because I believe in doing everything with spark, strategy, and a little blaze of confidence.
But don't get me wrong — I’ve also got the Electric-type focus of a Luxray when I’m locked in on a goal, the Water-type calm of a Greninja under pressure, and the Psychic-type clarity of a Gardevoir when things get deep.

Skills & Special Moves
Tech Stack: Java, C, Python, HTML, CSS
Web Dev: Crafting clean, fast, and responsive sites
DSA & Problem Solving: LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank
Soft Skills: Leadership, collaboration, clear communication
Special Abilities: Learning fast like a Porygon-Z, adapting faster like a Ditto

Current Mission:
Right now, I’m building a digital Pokédex of my own — a portfolio, where every project is a badge, every feature is a move, and every update is an evolution. I’m also working on a LeetCode Leaderboard, where I can compete (and collab) with other Trainers chasing their full potential.

Long-Term Goal:
Become a full-stack developer or AI engineer with Charizard-level impact — breathing fire into projects that solve real problems. And yeah, maybe drop a few Hyper Beams along the way.
